This code is to be run locally for now or one can use ngrok to view it on multiple devices easily.

The following node-dependencies need to be downloaded for this to run properly:
- firebase-functions
- cors
- express
- twilio
- body-parser
- request
- qr-image
- meraki
- file system (should be available when node is downloaded)
- cookie-parser


A firebase account is required to run and deploy this application. 
To run firebase locally, cd to the functions folder and enter 'firebase serve' to deploy the application.
If you receive an error saying firebase command is not found, run 'alias firebase="`npm config get prefix`/bin/firebase"' which may fix the problem.

To deploy externally run 'firebase deploy' (there were some problems so the application is not fully functioning with deploy).

Everytime the function for searching is run, users.json and sent.json will be updated. Next time the code is run, if those pages are not wiped of information
it will function improperly.

Upon startup, those two pages should say only {"users":[]} and {"sent":[]}. 

For every new router added to the network, information about it will have to be added to attributes.json.


As of 8/20/2019 our Cisco Meraki Router Liscence expired and a new one will need to be created to run the routers properly. 
A new twilio account will be needed if texts are going to be sent for the captive portal and for coupons.
